Maybe start from [this quarto file](powertargets.qmd), rendered [here as a pdf](outputs/powertargets.pdf). On Unix (linux or mac), you should be able to see the html by cloning the repo and saying `make Makefile` followed by `make powertargets.html.go`.

If you clone the repo, you should also be able to try the shiny app (cleverly named app.R)
