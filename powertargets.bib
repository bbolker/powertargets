  abstract = {This article gives an overview of sample size calculations for parallel group and cross-over studies with Normal data. Sample size derivation is given for trials where the objective is to demonstrate: superiority, equivalence, non-inferiority, bioequivalence and estimation to a given precision, for different types I and II errors. It is demonstrated how the different trial objectives influence the null and alternative hypotheses of the trials and how these hypotheses influence the calculations. Sample size tables for the different types of trials and worked examples are given. Copyright {\copyright} 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {A framework for hypothesis testing and power analysis in the assessment of fit of covariance structure models is presented. We emphasize the value of confidence intervals for fit indices, and we stress the relationship of confidence intervals to a framework for hypothesis testing. The approach allows for testing null hypotheses of not-good fit, reversing the role of the null hypothesis in conventional tests of model fit, so that a significant result provides strong support for good fit. The approach also allows for direct estimation of power, where effect size is defined in terms of a null and alternative value of the root-mean-square error of approximation fit index proposed by J. H. Steiger and J. M. Lind (1980). It is also feasible to determine minimum sample size required to achieve a given level of power for any test of fit in this framework. Computer programs and examples are provided for power analyses and calculation of minimum sample sizes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Tests of point hypotheses are common in observational environmental studies, but there is concern about their appropriateness. Exhortations to restrict sample sizes on the basis of a power analysis for such tests may fail to satisfy the environmental professional, because sample sizes are not always easily controlled. Testing of interval hypotheses via equiva-lence test procedures offers a way of testing meaningful hypotheses and of giving effect to the precautionary principle. An example is given which concerns mining impacts on stream benthic invertebrate communities, and includes calculation of Bayesian posterior probabilities.},
